<p>
In 2007, I moved to Silverton, Colorado. I went to live in quiet, to work
construction, and to connect with my estranged father. Silverton is a valley
town too, but it sits 2700 meters higher than Dundas and has a population 50
times smaller. Silverton is enclosed by mountains, and secluded in mythic and
mineral names: a former silver mining town, it&rsquo;s situated in the Animas River
Valley (&ldquo;Río de las Ánimas&rdquo;, &ldquo;River of Souls&rdquo;), in the San Juan Mountains (named
after Saint John the Baptist, &ldquo;the voice of one crying in the wilderness&rdquo;),
which are a young and jagged child range of the Rocky Mountains. The only
roadways in and out are a pair of mountain passes.
</p>

<p>
In the winter of 2007-2008 a series of record-rivaling snowstorms buried the
town in deep snow. The area received nearly 14 meters of snowfall. I took a side
gig shoveling if off roofs and at the end of a job, we&rsquo;d jump off a roof into
snowbanks. A buildings on Main Street collapsed under the weight of its snowcap.
The town was snowbound for days on end, with both passes closed off. I learned
some things about snow that year.

This ascent to a linguistic plane of reference is only a momentary retreat from
the world, for <b>the utility of the truth predicate is precisely the cancellation
of linguistic reference</b>. The truth predicate is a reminder that, despite a
technical ascent to talk of sentences, our eye is on the world. This
cancellatory force of the truth predicate is explicit in Tarski&rsquo;s paradigm:
</p>

<p>
&rsquo;Snow is white&rsquo; is true if and only if snow is white.
</p>

<p>
Quotation marks make all the difference between talking about words and talking
about snow. The quotation is a name of a sentence that contains a name, namely
&rsquo;snow&rsquo;, of snow. By calling the sentence true, we call snow white. <b>The truth
predicate is a device of disquotation</b> [emphasis mine].

In 2010, I met my partner while we were both studying for a year in Göttingen,
Germany. We shared our studies of philosophy and German literature and Kafka,
and we connected over the paradoxes of communication and the apparent
impossibility of reaching a shared understanding thru language.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It was late in the evening when K. arrived. The Village lay in deep Snow.
Nothing was to be seen of Castle hill, mist and darkness surrounded it, nor
did the weakest glimmer of light signify the great Castle. Long, K. stood on the
wood bridge that led from the country road to the Village and stared into the
phantasmal Emptiness above.
(Kafka, <i>Das Scholẞ</i>, translated from <i>Franz Kafka Gesamtwerk - Neuausgabe 9</i>)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The words as a bridge. The Castle as something undefined, unobserved we want to
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>stops at the bridge for a long time. Let us stop, too. Put aside</li>
</ol>
<p>
for a moment the connections we must make and the questions of our supervisors.
Let us linger for a time on the mere means of our entrance, within the obscure
opening of our text. 
</p>

<p>
We must have come from somewhere before we found ourselves on this page. Must K.
also have a history preceding his arrival? This question depends on the
ontological structure of literature.
</p>

<p>
Let our hesitation impede a retreat into the past no less than a leap into the
future. Let this life be our actual life. Let us attempt to see with clarity and
precision just that which lies before us at the moment of our arrival.
</p>

<p>
The village appears first as something lying deep in snow. Deep snowfall shapes
a townscape so softly. Angles and edges are smoothed. The forms of adjacent
buildings melt into one another. Before the ways are shoveled clear, house can
hardly be told from street. The lack of contrast is the starkest effect: after
some hours in the subtly shaded sea of white, color vision goes wonky.
</p>

<p>
Something about the structure of obstruction is revealed in the depths of a
blanket of snow; for depth of field is a condition of possibility for
concealment and only that which can be covered, or placed behind an opaque form,
can be hidden. Thus the invisibility of a world in the dark is not called
“hiddenness”: there is no apparent depth of field in the complete absence of
light. Only when the dark can take on the characteristic of a fabric or an
eclipse, only when darkness is seen in contrast to an apparent light, as a
presence of obscurity, do we say “it hides something.” Hiddenness is a form of
veiled appearance. When a village is hidden in the depths of fresh-fallen snow,
what appears is a gentle blanket of brilliant white. The brilliance shines also
by moon or starlight.
</p>

<p>
But covering does not always or only obscure. What gives itself to be felt
through touch can only be perceived via the covering contact. Heidegger, in his
<i>Introduction to Phenomenological Research</i> (given in the winter semester of
1923-1924), attempted to expose the etymon of ‘phenomenon’ to reveal the
condition of possibility for visible appearance. He quotes Aristotle thus,
“‘what is perceivable in seeing is the visible;’” and continues in his own
terms,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
something of this sort is characterized as color. Color is what is spread over
something visible in itself. The respective coloring of an entity is perceived
each time <i>en photi</i>, in light, more precisely, in daylight [/im Hellen/].
</p>

<p>
Thus, the first thing to be made out is what daylight is. Daylight is
apparently something that lets something else be seen through it, diaphanes
[transparent]. This daylight is not of itself visible, but only by means of a
color alien to it (Heidegger, Introduction to Phenomenological Research 5)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What is seen shows itself through what cannot, as pure transparency, be seen at
all and what we perceive through the transparency of light is color. Color
covers the surfaces of the things to be seen; yet it covers them like a stain,
infused into texture and form. There is no depth to the covering color; thus we
see that it is not covering that effects concealment but depth and distance
themselves. Indeed, the simple vastness of distance is enough to hide gargantuan
forms in its depths, despite the fact that naught but the transparency of light
stands between them and us. Yet we know that light is more than mere
transparency, or else it could not blind us.
</p>

<p>
Though light is transparency and the condition of visibility, we would be wrong
to assume, through a simplistic inversion, that darkness is opacity and the
condition of invisibility. Much appears in the spectral lights of night.
“Darkness,” remarks Heidegger, “is something that, in a quite specific way, lets
things be seen” (Heidegger, Introduction to Phenomenological Research 7). Again,
quoting Aristotle:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Not everything is visible in light, but only the proper color of each thing.
For some things are not seen in light but produce perception in the dark, such
as things that appear fire-like (De anima, Beta 7, 418b4) (Heidegger,
Introduction to Phenomenological Research 7)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Tarrying on the bridge, which connects our main road to the village of The
Castle, a great deal is revealed through the Castle&rsquo;s failure to appear in the
darkness. The apparent invisibility of the Castle, and of the hill that holds it
aloft, is significant, particularly in the difference between the modes of their
nonappearance: the castle hill is concealed by the surrounding mist and gloom;
the Castle itself is undisclosed in the absence of apparent light, which would
otherwise give indication. Mention of the lack of twinkling lights draws
attention to the lack of mention of another sort of glimmering light source:
namely, the stars. It is not clear whether we’re standing beneath a starless sky
or if they simply escape notice but, above all, we gaze into the phantasm of
emptiness. Phantasmal emptiness is the manner in which the impossibly far away
appears: like the illusion of empty space between the stars or the absence of
essential meaning in the world. Beyond the all too visible village, lying deep
in the conspicuous ambiguity of its snow blanket, there looms the hidden and the
veiled; above all, the stark absence of what we expect to appear.
