<h3 id="orgd859828">What is a shell?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd859828">
<p>
If your familiar with the computery sense of <i>shell</i>, there&rsquo;s a good chance
you think a shell is something particular to a command-line terminal
environment. In that case, you can join me and others I&rsquo;ve talked to in being
delightfully surprised to learn that shell, even in the narrow computery
sense, is a much more general thing: &ldquo;a user interface for access to an
operating system&rsquo;s services&rdquo;<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
The vast majority of computer users toil their entire computing day away
inside an infamous shell that is generally unrecognized as such: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_shell">the Windows
shell</a>. The terminal-bound <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">CLIs</a> often taken to be synonymous with <i>shell</i>
simpliciter are only a special case of a much more general concept in the
architecture of human-computer interface.
</p>

<p>
This concept has an interesting history and, as I will try to show,
fascinating and important implications for how we think about the use of and
interface with computers.

<h3 id="org1fca41e">Why go deeper into the shell?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1fca41e">
<p>
The aim of this remark is to solidify and share my personal meditation on the
history, nature, and implications of the shell concept. Though I am
primarily concerned with computer shells, a deeper understanding of their
characteristics and potential can be nurtured by some early attention to more
general senses of the term <i>shell</i>.
</p>

<p>
The most concrete sense of the word is the one with physical significance.
The most technical physical sense, used by engineers to describe a structural
pattern, is remarkably abstract:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A shell is a type of structural element which is characterized by its
geometry, being a three-dimensional solid whose thickness is very small when
compared with other dimensions
—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(structure)"> wikipedia.org</a>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, <i>shell</i> is taken to describe a vast class of three-dimensional solids.
<b>Why does it matter?</b>&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
To recall the more mundane and more concrete senses, we can appeal to the
term&rsquo;s etymology.
</p>

<p>
According to <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=shell&amp;allowed_in_frame=0">etymonline.org</a>, the earliest etymon of <i>shell</i> is the speculated
Proto-Indo-European root <i>*skel-</i>, &ldquo;to cut&rdquo;. This root claims common ground
for a number of Germanic words with a similar sound, including the Old
English <i>scealu</i>, &ldquo;shell, husk&rdquo;, and others meaning &ldquo;piece cut off, rind, egg
shell&rdquo;, &ldquo;peel&rdquo;, and &ldquo;tile&rdquo;, tied to words like <i>*skaljo</i>, <i>skyl</i>, and
<i>schelle</i>. The unifying concept suggested by etymonline is that of a
&ldquo;covering that splits off&rdquo;. A couple common notions take shape through these
ancient determinations: A shell protects, hides or covers, or did so once. A
shell is removable.
</p>

<p>
Common senses of the term settle down to mark a topic congruent with our
target sense as the English usage goes on:
</p>

<pre class="example">
   Sense of "mere exterior" is from 1650s; that of "hollow framework" is
   from 1791. Meaning "structure for a band or orchestra" is attested
   from 1938.
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6f2c393" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6f2c393">What&rsquo;s the difference between a shell and a cli in general?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6f2c393">
<p>
A shell, in the computing sense, is not synonymous with a command line
interface (CLI). Most CLIs are not shells (though most CLI are probably
launched by a shell) and the most widely used shell is not a CLI.
</p>

<p>
A shell is a program that provides an interface for a user to interact with
an operating system. True to the etymological coincidence of &rsquo;shell&rsquo; and
&rsquo;husk&rsquo; in the Old English <i>scaelu</i>, the shell is so called because it was the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husk">husk</a> enclosing the operating system&rsquo;s <i>kernel</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is a potent metaphor. Let&rsquo;s press the underlying analogy until it
breaks, so we can see what it&rsquo;s made of.
</p>

<p>
A husk is a shell that protects a seed. We sometimes think and talk as if the
seed itself were the germ whence plants grow, but that&rsquo;s incorrect: plants
grow from their <i>embryo</i>, the <i>germ</i>. A seed&rsquo;s destiny is to transport and
preserve its germ until it can find fertile ground. Having found a place
where it can settle, the seed nourishes the germ. As the germ develops into a
seedling, the latter should break free of the shell. Thence, the germ quickly
outgrows and consumes its kernel. If all goes will, the newly sprouted
seedling will realize a self-sufficient form of growth, and begin feeding on
intake from the world at large.
</p>

<p>
A seed&rsquo;s husk provides protective enclosure while the seed itself nurtures
and enables the development of the germ: given the proper conditions, this
trinity will sprout, take root, and grow into something miraculously
different. If a shell encloses an operating system&rsquo;s kernel, providing an
interface to the user, where, if at all, do we find the analog of the germ,
the computer&rsquo;s embryo? What, if anything, does this become in the optimal
conditions?
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc049651" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgc049651">The seed of the <i>kernel</i> concept lies in the origin of the operating system</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc049651">
<p>
In a nutshell, a <i>kernel</i> is a seed program at the core of an operating
system. The kernel maintains complete control over everything in the system,
and orchestrates access to the underlying hardware, on which the
computations are actually orchestrated.
</p>

<p>
To develop an understanding of the kernel concept adequate to nurturing a
robust understanding of the shell concept, we&rsquo;ll have to cultivate an
understanding of the kernel concept that is more expansive. It is one thing
to say &ldquo;the kernel is the core of an operating system&rdquo;. It is another thing
to know what an operating system is, why operating systems have cores, what
kind of operations an operating system performs, and what kind of system it
operates.
</p>

<p>
We are digging for insights into the essence of the concepts rather than
technical details about how the things that now bear those names happen to
be constituted. Suppose I were capable of explaining the intricate technical
details of the Linux kernel, the exact mechanisms by which it relates to,
and is accessible from, a popular shell like Bash or Zsh, and how these
things stand in relation to a given Linux distribution. (I am <i>not</i> but
let&rsquo;s suppose I were.) This explanation would not tell us much about the
nature of an operating system in the <i>abstract</i>. It would tell us nothing
about the kernel concept as such and provide very little insight into the
essential nature and promise of the shell. To get at these things, we want a
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy_(philosophy)">genealogical inquiry</a></i>.
</p>

<p>
The origin of the shell concept lies in that of time sharing systems. Time
sharing systems were a pivotal innovation on the operating system: in
essence, modern kernels are just the persistent form of the original
operating systems. The origin of these foundational systems lies in the
complex social and mechanical constellations of the old computing machine
rooms.
</p>

<p>
In order to get a visceral sense of why these machine rooms gave birth to
operating and time sharing systems, we need a concrete understanding of what
it was like to work with those beasts.

In the 1950s, computing machines where gigantic, expensive, and rare. Robert
L. Patrick worked on developing some of the earliest operating systems and
the operational practices that preceded systematic automation. In 1987,
Patrick was asked by ??? to prepare a paper<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> reflecting on his work
developing systems for operating these kinds of devices.
</p>

<p>
The roots of this work go back to 1954, wrote Patrick. At that time, he was
working on an IBM 701. The 701 was IBM&rsquo;s first commercial scientific
computer. It rented for over $23,000 a month and filled a 40 foot by 40 foot
room. It was a &ldquo;single sequencing machine&rdquo;, meaning it could only execute
one stage of a computation task at a time: e.g., if it was reading input, it
was <b>only</b> reading input, not processing anything, until the entire input
was consumed. Like other machines of this era, it was composed of an
interrelated system of heterogeneous storage and processing devices that
needed lots of attention and manual care: a typical configuration
consisted of
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a punch card reader</li>
<li>a punch card puncher (for machine-readable output)</li>
<li>a 150-line-per-minute printer (for human-readable output)</li>
<li>an internal memory of 2,000 36-bit words</li>
<li>four magnetic tapes</li>
<li>a magnetic drum</li>
</ul>

<p>
Operating these bohemoths was intricate, complex, and fraught:
</p>

<pre class="example">
    The typical mode of operating was programmer present and at the operating
    console. When a programmer got ready for a test shot, he or she signed up
    on a first-in, first-out list, much like the list at a crowded restaurant.
    The programmer then checked progress frequently to estimate when he would
    reach the top. When his time got close, he stod by with card deck in hand.
    When the previous person finished or ran out of alloted time or abruptly
    crashed, the next programmer rushed in, checked that the proper board was
    installed in the card reader, checked that the proper board was installed in
    the printer, checked that the proper board was installed on the punch, hung
    a magnetic tape ..., punched in on a mechanical time clock, addressed the
    console, set some switches, loaded his punched card deck in the card reader,
    prayed the first card would not jam, and pressed the load button to invoke
    the bootstrap sequence.

    If all went well, you could load a typical deck of about 300 cards and begin
    the execution of your first instruction about 5 minutes after entering the
    machine room. If only one person did all this set up and got going in five
    minutes, he bustled around the machine room like a whirling dervish.
</pre>

<p>
According to Patrick&rsquo;s account, the preparation and setup rarely went
perfectly. Butter-fingered programmers were prone to squander the entirety
of their test time fumbling the setup and correcting for mishaps. This was
costly: in addition to squandering the programmer&rsquo;s time, the tedious and
error prone load times wasted compute time. Operating the computer was a
manual processes and if operators worked twelve hours a day, seven days per
week, with a rental price of $23,000 per month, compute time would still be
priced at about $67 per hour. (That&rsquo;s in 1954 dollars. In 2017, it would be
about $620 per hour.)
</p>

<p>
This was the muck in which the operating system took root. The earliest
steps made towards systematization recounted by Patrick were simple measures
to improve the reliability and efficiency of operation: e.g., organizing
programmer-operators to work in teams so there was always an assistant or
standardizing plug boards to reduce the need for switching. Some important
technical improvements also contributed. Most worthy of note, perhaps, was
the advent of &ldquo;interpretive programming packages&rdquo;, such as
[Speedcoding](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcoding">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcoding</a>). These &ldquo;high-level&rdquo;
languages abstracted away from hardware instructions, providing a
human-readable language for specifying machines programs.
</p>

<p>
The specification of an operating system was for the IBM 704, developed as a
collaborative effort between GM and North Western ?? and the SHARE group
???. I will provide the highlights from Patrick&rsquo;s highlights, to give a
sense for what exactly an operating system consisted in:

<p>
I was recently made aware that I had a very shallow understanding of the
standard Linux command line interface (CLI) shell. As I began studying
to overcome this superficiality, I discovered that the term <i>shell</i> invokes
deep historical and conceptual roots and that its contemporary relevance
extends well beyond the standard CLI&rsquo;s in use by IT professionals.
</p>

<p>
If you haven&rsquo;t had occasion to do a deep dive into the concept of a shell,
you might harbor the same kind of misconceptions I did. You might think that
a shell is a CLI in general, or that a shell has something to do with
Unix-like environments in particular (which has a kernel of truth, but only
for historical reasons). You might know that that there are different *nix
shells — such as <i>sh</i>, <i>bash</i>, and <i>zsh</i> —

The UNIX Time-sharing System A Retrospective*
</p>

<p>
&gt; In most ways UNIX is a very conservative system. Only a handful of its
ideas are genuinely new. In fact, a good case can be made that it is in
essence a modern implementation of MIT&rsquo;s CTSS system [1]. This claim is
intended as a compliment to both UNIX and CTSS. Today, more than fifteen
years after CTSS was born, few of the interactive systems we know of are
superior to it in ease of use; many are inferior in basic design.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org428c143">
<blockquote>
<p>
Time-sharing was a misnomer. While it did allow the sharing of a central
computer, its success derives from the ability to share other resources: data,
programs, concepts. It cracked a critical path bottleneck for writing and
debugging programs. In theory this could have been achieved as well with a
direct access approach. In practice it could not.
</p>

<p>
Direct access hems users in a static framework. Evolution is unfrequent and
controlled by central and distant agents. Creativity is out of the user&rsquo;s hand.
</p>

<p>
Time sharing, as it became popular, is a living organism in which any user, with
various degrees of expertise, can create new objects, test them, and make them
available to others, without administrative control and hassle. With the
internet experience, this no longer need be substantiated.

<blockquote>
<p>
CTSS was developed during 1963 and 64. I was at MIT on the computer center staff
at that time. After having written dozens of commands for CTSS, I reached the
stage where I felt that commands should be usable as building blocks for writing
more commands, just like subroutine libraries. Hence, I wrote &ldquo;RUNCOM&rdquo;, a sort
of shell driving the execution of command scripts, with argument substitution.
The tool became instantly most popular, as it became possible to go home in the
evening while leaving behind long runcoms executing overnight.

If we have a sequence of commands we issue often, to many different actors,

a single script which records the sequence of commands, and then simply

Old English <i>sciell</i>, <i>scill</i>, Anglian <i>scell</i> &ldquo;seashell, eggshell,&rdquo; related to Old

Sense of &ldquo;mere exterior&rdquo; is from 1650s; that of &ldquo;hollow framework&rdquo; is from 1791.
Meaning &ldquo;structure for a band or orchestra&rdquo; is attested from 1938. Military use
(1640s) was first of hand grenades, in reference to the metal case in which the
gunpowder and shot were mixed; the notion is of a &ldquo;hollow object&rdquo; filled with
explosives. Hence shell shock, first recorded 1915. Shell game &ldquo;a swindle&rdquo; is
from 1890, from a version of three-card monte played with a pea and walnut
