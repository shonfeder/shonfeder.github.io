<p>
<b>Interviewer:</b> Could you give us a broad justification of why category theory
may be so useful?
</p>

<p>
<b>William Lawvere:</b> Everyday human activities such as building a house on a hill
by a stream, laying a network of telephone conduits, navigating the solar
system, require plans that can work. Planning any such undertaking requires the
development of thinking about space. Each development involves many steps of
thought and many related geometrical constructions on spaces. Because of the
necessary multistep nature of thinking about space, uniquely mathematical
measures must be taken to make it reliable. Only explicit principles of thinking
(logic) and explicit principles of of space (geometry) can guarantee
reliability. The great advance made by the theory [of categories] invented 60
years ago by Eilenberg and Mac Lane permitted making the principles of logic and
geometry explicit; this was accomplished by discovering the common form of logic
and geometry so that the principles of the relation between the two are also
explicit. They solved a problem opened 2300 years earlier by Aristotle with his
initial inroads into making explicit the Categories of Concepts. In the 21st
century, their solution is applicable not only to plane geometry and to medieval
syllogisms, but also to infinite-dimensional spaces of transformations, to
&ldquo;spaces&rdquo; of data, and to other conceptual tools that are applied thousands of
times a day. The form of the principles of both logic and geometry was
discovered by categorists to rest on &ldquo;naturality&rdquo; of the transformations between
spaces and transformations within thought.

<h2 id="org8475447">Naming Problems</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8475447">
<p>
I have been working on an OCaml library for representing computationally useful
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure">algebraic structures</a> as composable modules.<sup><a id="fnr.justification" class="footref" href="#fn.justification" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> The library
involves lots of module-level programming and is modeled after Haskell&rsquo;s
representation of such structures in its typeclasses. The techniques I&rsquo;m using
for representing these structures in OCaml modules have been demonstrated and
developed by numerous people already, and I am borrowing from (and referencing)
their work. My only contribution is in taking the time to go through the tree of
Haskell typeclasses and leverage those techniques to port the structures into a
documented, tested, and packaged OCaml library.
</p>

<p>
Up to this point, I have implemented a non-trivial core of common structures and
I have been making use of these in my OCaml port of <a href="https://github.com/shonfeder/these"><code>These</code></a>. I am currently
doing the <a href="../../themata/finishing-the-incomplete.html">finishing work</a> required to prepare the library for publication.
</p>

<p>
The provisional name for this library has been <code>Alg</code>, short for &ldquo;algebra&rdquo;, short
for &ldquo;algebraic structure&rdquo;. However, a fruitful discussion with a seasoned OCaml
contributor convinced me that I should be mindful of the price of real estate in
the opam package repository namespace. <i>Alg</i> is a pretty pricey string: it is
brief, early in the alphabet, and evocative enough it might be used for a dozen
other things. In contrast, the library I have been developing is quite
experimental<sup><a id="fnr.experimental" class="footref" href="#fn.experimental" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> and my initial implementation is likely to be
utterly imperfect<sup><a id="fnr.imperfect" class="footref" href="#fn.imperfect" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>. It doesn&rsquo;t seem fitting that I should colonize
such a precious plot of signs. So I&rsquo;ve been hunting for a more suitable name.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbcc7567" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbcc7567">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in a name?&rdquo;</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbcc7567">
<p>
Why does the name matter? Why not just pick some clunky, explicit phrase like
<code>experimental_algebraic_structures</code>, or a cute, vaguely meaningful portmanteau
like <code>meowlgebra</code>?
</p>

<p>
The cliched rhetorical question &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in a name?&rdquo; is usually taken to
denigrate names, but it is drawn from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_rose_by_any_other_name_would_smell_as_sweet">this famous passage in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i></a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Juliet:</b>
</p>

<p>
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I&rsquo;ll no longer be a Capulet
</p>

<p>
<b>Romeo:</b>
</p>

<p>
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
</p>

<p>
<b>Juliet:</b>
</p>

<p>
&rsquo;Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What&rsquo;s Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What&rsquo;s in a name? That which we call
a rose By any other name would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo
call&rsquo;d, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. Romeo,
doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
</p>

<p>
<b>Romeo:</b>
</p>

<p>
I take thee at thy word: Call me but love, and I&rsquo;ll be new baptized; Henceforth
I never will be Romeo.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This passage does not demonstrate the insignificance of names. On the contrary,
it presents a scenario in which names are of decisive importance.
</p>

<p>
Romeo&rsquo;s name marks him as an enemy because &rsquo;Mantague&rsquo; brands him as a foe of the
Capulets. The famous line, &ldquo;That which we call a rose/By any other name would
smell as sweet;&rdquo; clearly claims that the sense properties of objects are not
affected by their names (tho I suspect in a world where roses were called
&ldquo;shit-blossoms&rdquo;, they might smell a bit like doo doo). However, the whole
exchange revolves around the fact that appellations reflect and help actualize
important structures in reality.
</p>

<p>
Names work to reinforce social orders and designate belonging, which is why
Juliet conjoins &ldquo;Deny thy father&rdquo; with &ldquo;refuse they name&rdquo; as if these acts where
inseparable. While names are not essential properties of people (or most other
things) (&ldquo;that name which is no part of thee&rdquo;), they nonetheless bind beings
into relationships that form structures with a very real being of their own.
Romeo and Juliet&rsquo;s rebellion against their families&rsquo; feud presents a claim for
the independent value of freely chosen, dyadic, romantic relations. It even
asserts the superior value of this personal dyadic structure over the structures
of familial and political affiliation into which we are thrown in being born.
According to Juliet, the person can be extricated from the bondage to their
inherited enmity, emancipated from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasces">fascistic</a> structure of their family (or
nation), because the tribe is not a part of the person:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&rsquo;Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What&rsquo;s Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yet the name <b>is</b> a part of those fascistic structures, which is why it seems
one pays for such emancipation by forsaking one&rsquo;s given name &#x2013; &ldquo;O, be some
other name!&rdquo; &#x2013; and being reborn through renaming &ldquo;Call me but love, and I&rsquo;ll be
new baptized;/ Henceforth I never will be Romeo.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thought moves through language<sup><a id="fnr.language" class="footref" href="#fn.language" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> and finds its ways through systems
of signs<sup><a id="fnr.systems-of-signs" class="footref" href="#fn.systems-of-signs" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>. These systems suggest certain possibilities and
foreclose others. Since the significance of names comes from their situation
within networks of differentiation, naming enacts a positioning of the named
thing in a space of proximate thoughts.
</p>

<p>
What is in a name? A passage from the named thing to a situation in a network of
associated thoughts and recollections which bind beings into objective,
intersubjective, and purely subjective structures of possibility.

<h2 id="org2e270ea">Giving Names is Making Metaphor</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2e270ea">
<p>
To name a newborn (person, thing, or thought) is almost always to give it the
name of something else. Initially, no thing or person can name itself. As a
rule, a precondition of a name coming to belong to something (&ldquo;my name&rdquo;, &ldquo;your
name&rdquo;, &ldquo;its name&rdquo;) is that someone first &ldquo;names it after&rdquo; some other thing(s).
According to Aristotle in the <i>Poetics</i>, this is the very definition of
metaphor : “Metaphor consists in giving the thing a name that belongs to
something else” (1457b). Aristotle states quite explicitly that making metaphor
sets the named thing in relation to that after which it is named, and, moreover,
that it is an art that cannot be taught:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
the greatest thing by far is to be a master of metaphor. It is the one thing
that cannot be learnt from others; and it is also a sign of genius, since a good
metaphor implies an intuitive perception of the similarity in dissimilars
</p>

<p>
(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Aristotle 1984, 1459</a> a))
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I&rsquo;ll postulate here that to recognize &ldquo;similarity in dissimilars&rdquo;, can only be
achieved through identification of structural correspondence<sup><a id="fnr.similarity" class="footref" href="#fn.similarity" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup>. To
bestow upon <i>A</i> a name that belongs to <i>B</i> is to establish a way for thought.
This way has the potential to &ldquo;<a href="https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=metaphor">carry thought across</a>&rdquo; from consideration of the
singular being of <i>A</i> to the being of <i>B</i> (or broadly to all those things which
bear the name). This brings thoughts of <i>A</i> into the same constellations that
we&rsquo;ve formed for the circulation of our thoughts of <i>B</i>. Naming is thus a speech
act which transforms the topology of being, insofar as the connectedness of
beings is mutually determined with the connectedness of thoughts.
</p>

<p>
When we <i>misname</i> a thing, we misplace it into the complex of structures that
contribute to the determination of being. This can effect a deformation of the
orders of being and impose real ruptures in the proper connectedness of things
(at least insofar as intersubjectivity contributes to the constitution of
reality). Making bad metaphor miscarries thought, since it actualizes relations
between thoughts that are &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo;, in the sense that they disrupt the
corelation of &ldquo;transformations between spaces and transformations within
thought&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
I don&rsquo;t know if this yields any insight for the reader (or for myself), but it
at least presents one account of why naming <i>well</i> is hard and why it matters.

<p>
This ramble records traces of the many sources I&rsquo;ve dipped into as I&rsquo;ve worked
to discover a suitable name for the nascent library. My reading took me through
Haskell docs, Wikipedia articles, articles by and about William Lawvere,
articles by and about Hermann Grassmann, old writings from my unfinished thesis,
(where I found the Aristotle excerpted above), numerous dictionaries, and I even
followed a cliche to Shakespeare&rsquo;s most overrated play. I have managed to
convince myself that naming matters: I believe that the metaphorizing nature of
name-bestowal, and the situatedness it determines, places the practice of naming
as one poetic analog of the formal techniques pursued and developed in category
theory. The common concern is to discover (and improve) the &ldquo;naturalness&rdquo; that
allows transformations of being (spaces) and transformations of thought to align
in accordance with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-established_harmony">harmony</a> (which we may hope for as eventual rather than
posit as pre-established).
</p>

<p>
But, did this wandering way help me come up with a suitable name? Yes! Just a
moment ago &#x2013; as I was laughing at myself for how much time I spent digging
around in marginalia and stringing together arguably frivolous connections, only
to turn up empty handed &#x2013; my thoughts wound around in a way that resemble this
sequence:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Well, what have I learned through my reading and writing today?
</p>

<p>
A name should help situate the named thing in it&rsquo;s proper relations. In the act
of naming we help establish order in the structures of thought, in the hopes
that they reflect and can <b>effect</b> the structures of being in ways that we deem
to be good and natural. So, think on what this library properly is, how it
works, and what it does. What names can we give to it (names which must first
belong to other things) that will help guide it into connection with the things
among which it belongs?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I let my attention float over some source code and then &#x2013; eureka &#x2013; inspiration
struck! I present to you <a href="https://github.com/shonfeder/alg_structs"><code>alg_structs</code></a>
</p>

<p>
At first glance, this name appears stupidly obvious: It&rsquo;s just an abbreviation
for &ldquo;algebraic structures&rdquo;! I noted that <code>Alg</code> was an abbreviation for this
phrase way back &#x2013; hours of writing and studying ago &#x2013; in paragraph one.
</p>

<p>
On further consideration, you&rsquo;ll probably realize that it is not only stupidly
obvious and overly literal, it is also longish and ugly sounding. It doesn&rsquo;t
even look pretty.
</p>

<p>
However, you may not have noticed that it is also a <i>pun</i>! :P

This is all in accord with the ML module system that was developed in the early
80s. The spirit of the ML module system traces back to an effort to &ldquo;give
structured descriptions of theories&rdquo;, and the theories that are to be described
are &ldquo;algebraic theories&rdquo; as developed by Lawvere.

In &ldquo;Modules for Standard ML&rdquo;, which proposes all of the most important aspects
of ML modules, David McQueen wrote:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This proposal is based on the fruits of a long collaboration with Rod Burstall
on prototype designs for modules in Hope [MAC81], and on theoretical
investigations with Ravi Sethi and Gordon Plotkin [MAC82, MAC84] that were
motivated by those designs. The module designs for Hope were in turn influenced
by the Clear specification language of Burstall and Goguen [BUR77].

&ldquo;[BUR77]&rdquo; refers to Burstall and Goguen&rsquo;s paper &ldquo;Putting theories together to
make specifications.&rdquo; The first line reads:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We have been developing a language in which you can give structured
descriptions of theories.
</p>

<p>
(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">Burstall and Goguen 1977</a>)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Under the section &ldquo;What we mean by a theory&rdquo;, they explain
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The notion of theory is a loose intuitive one in mathematics. There should be
axioms, rules of inference and theorems, but the language in which they are
expressed is open to choice. &#x2026; We have chosen an algebraic notion of theory,
due to Lawvere (1963) [references his 1963 thesis <i>Functorial Semantics Of Algebraic
Theories</i> (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">Lawvere 1963</a>)] &#x2026;
</p>

[<a href="cite:Burstall:1977:PTT:1622943.1623045">cite:Burstall:1977:PTT:1622943.1623045</a> p. 1047]
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Later they give their definition of a theory and an algebra:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A <span class="underline">theory</span> is a signature together with a set of equations closed under
inference by reflexivity, transitivity and symmetry of equality and by
substitution.
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The interpretations of a theory are algebras, where an algebra is a collection
of sets, one for each sort, with a function over these sets assigned to each
operator of the theory.
</p>

<p>
[<a href="cite:Burstall:1977:PTT:1622943.1623045">cite:Burstall:1977:PTT:1622943.1623045</a> p. 1048]
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
OCaml modules are faithful to this design.
</p>

<p>
The <code>sig</code> specifies the signature, which Burstall and Goguen define as &ldquo;a set of
sort names and a set of operator symbols, each with a given sequence of sorts
for its arguments and sequence of sorts for its results (1047)&rdquo;. This is
precisely what ML signatures specify, tho we now say <i>type</i> where they said
<i>sort</i>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>struct</code> provides the set of equations. The reflexivity, transitivity and
symmetry of equations is taken care of by the typed lambda calculus.
</p>

<p>
I intend to explore the concepts and implications of these connections at
length, and have begun gathering notes in <a href="../../themata/programming/the-measure-of-a-module.html">The Measure of a Module</a>. For now, I&rsquo;ll
leave it at this: <code>alg_structs</code> aims to provide a library of computationally
interesting algebraic structures. It represents these structures as modules
implemented via <code>structs</code> and specified via <code>sigs</code>. The roots of the ML module
system trace back to an effort to specify programs via algebraic theories. This
traces out a little lopsided (perhaps spiralling?) circle, and I think that&rsquo;s a
good sign: the punning in the name reflects the nesting of similar structures,
and I&rsquo;m comfortable with taking that as proxy for naturalness.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the name is fitting since the preponderance of <code>structs</code> needed to
specify relatively simple algebraic structures is gonna have users exclaiming
&ldquo;ALl these God damn STRUCTS?!&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s an example of an implementation of
semigroup for <code>Option</code> types:

One might argue that recognition of the same or similar qualia
appearing in two different compounds is not predicated on structural
correspondence. But I would respond that differentiation of discrete qualitative
unities presupposes a structuring operation that articulates the continuum of
possible qualities. Of course, this amounts to a rejection of any sort of
qualitative atomism on my part.
